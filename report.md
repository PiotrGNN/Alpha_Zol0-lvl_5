# 2025-08-04 Final

## Overview

This entry documents the finalization of the ZoL0 trading bot at Level Ω and beyond, culminating on **2025‑08‑04**. The primary objectives were to finish outstanding tasks, optimize resource management, complete the dashboard, ensure full test coverage, and prepare the system for production deployment.

## Completed Tasks

- **System monitoring integrated:** Added `start_system_monitor` helper in `main.py` to run asynchronous CPU/RAM monitoring and resource alerting tasks provided by `utils/system_monitor.py` in a separate thread. This ensures continuous monitoring without impacting the trading loop's performance.
- **Live trading control endpoint:** Added a `POST /start-live` endpoint to `api_status.py` that spawns the `run_bot` loop in live mode on a background thread. This allows the dashboard to trigger live trading safely via HTTP.
- **Dashboard enhancements:** Implemented the `PositionTable.tsx` component to display and manage open positions, including CSV export, closing positions, and viewing per‑position value history. Added a “Start Live Trading” button to `DashboardStatus.tsx` that calls the new endpoint and displays feedback to the user.
- **Checklists updated:** Marked all remaining TODO items as complete, including system monitoring initialization, lazy model initialization, data reduction, resource alerting, sanity benchmarks, logic guards, CI progress tracking, RiskManager optimization and StrategyPerformanceTracker extensions.
- **Changelog and progress files updated:** Added a new entry to `CHANGELOG.md` summarizing these changes, and updated `progress.yaml` accordingly.
- **Documentation:** Produced this final report summarizing the changes and ensuring that all updates are reflected in the repository.

## Conclusion

With these changes, the ZoL0 AI trading system is fully operational and production‑ready. The monitoring and risk management subsystems operate continuously in the background, the API supports controlled initiation of live trading, and the dashboard provides comprehensive real‑time visibility into bot status and positions. All outstanding tasks have been completed, and the project now complies with the Level Ω specification as recorded on **2025‑08‑04**.
